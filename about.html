            <h3> What special features have you done or attempted in creating the website?</h3>
            <p>I have not implemented any special features in my website.</p>

            <h3>Which part(s) did you have trouble with?</h3>
            <p>I did not have any trouble with the assignment however reading documentations are trying to implement them was troubling sometimes</p>

            <h3> What would you like to do better next time?</h3>
            <p>I would like to touch up more on css and styling e.g. using good colour contrast, utlising the page more</p>

            <h3>What you have learnt along the way? Did you use any references or resources during this project? If so, please include the sources.</h3>
            <p>Things that i learned along the way was trying to get the value of the checkboxes being select.<br> 
                I used the pg. <a href = "https://makitweb.com/get-checked-checkboxes-value-with-php/">https://makitweb.com/get-checked-checkboxes-value-with-php/</a> for my better unnderstanding. <br>
                Other things that I learned along the way is having a better understanding of sql commands through W3school.
